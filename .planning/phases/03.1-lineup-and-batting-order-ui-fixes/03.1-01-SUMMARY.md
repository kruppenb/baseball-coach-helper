# Phase 3.1 Plan 01: UI Fixes Summary

**Band-free batting order list and vertical lineup option cards with per-player bench rotation summaries**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-10T23:16:26Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-10T23:17:53Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Removed band badges (top/middle/bottom colored labels) from batting order list -- coaches found these confusing
- Converted lineup option cards from horizontal scroll to vertical stack -- fully visible on mobile without scrolling
- Replaced per-inning bench summary with per-player bench summary showing who sits which innings

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove band badges from BattingOrderList** - `2eeed22` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix LineupOptions to vertical cards with compact bench summary** - `927d4fa` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/batting-order/BattingOrderList.tsx` - Removed getBand import, bandStyleMap, band badge span; now renders position number + name only
- `src/components/batting-order/BattingOrderList.module.css` - Removed .bandLabel, .top, .middle, .bottom CSS classes
- `src/components/lineup/LineupOptions.tsx` - New getCompactBenchSummary function; renders "Bench: Alex (1, 4), Sam (2, 5)" per card
- `src/components/lineup/LineupOptions.module.css` - Changed .cardContainer to flex-direction: column; cards now width: 100%

## Decisions Made
- Removed band badges entirely rather than simplifying them -- UAT showed coaches were confused by colored labels
- Per-player bench summary sorted by first bench inning number (ascending) for consistent, predictable ordering
- Edge case of exactly 9 players (no bench) shows "No bench" text

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- BattingOrderList and LineupOptions UI fixes complete
- Ready for plan 03.1-02 (additional UI fixes if any)
- BattingBand type intentionally kept in types/index.ts -- still used by fairness algorithm in batting-order.ts

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 4 modified files exist on disk
- Commit `2eeed22` (Task 1) verified in git log
- Commit `927d4fa` (Task 2) verified in git log
- TypeScript compiles cleanly (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- All 52 tests pass (`npx vitest run`)
