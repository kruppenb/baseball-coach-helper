# Phase 3.1 Plan 02: Fairness Summary Summary

**Per-player fairness summary table showing infield innings and bench innings counts below the lineup grid**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-10T23:16:29Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-10T23:18:08Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created FairnessSummary presentational component rendering a table with Player/Infield/Bench columns
- Added computeFairnessSummary pure function computing per-player infield and bench innings from lineup data
- Wired FairnessSummary into LineupPage below LineupGrid, visible when a lineup is selected

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create FairnessSummary component** - `deec7fc` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Wire FairnessSummary into LineupPage** - `f27ea64` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/lineup/FairnessSummary.tsx` - Pure presentational table component with PlayerFairness interface
- `src/components/lineup/FairnessSummary.module.css` - Table styles using CSS custom properties from tokens.css
- `src/components/lineup/LineupPage.tsx` - Added computeFairnessSummary function and FairnessSummary rendering

## Decisions Made
- computeFairnessSummary is a module-level pure function (not a hook or useMemo) -- keeps it testable and follows the existing pattern where container pages own computation
- FairnessSummary rendered as sibling to LineupGrid inside the same section div, using margin-top for spacing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Fairness summary complete; resolves the pending todo from Phase 2 and Phase 3 UAT
- LineupGrid was not modified (verified via git diff)
- All 52 existing tests pass, TypeScript compiles cleanly

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files exist. All commits verified.
